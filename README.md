# Ball and Beam Control System

This is an application for calculating deflection, shear forces, and bending moments of beams with various types of loadings and different number of supports.

## Prerequisites
For using this program it is necessary to install these softwares on your local machine.
* MATLAB software
* AppDesigner toolbox

## Features
* This program can solve problems with just one beam.
* Number of supports is not limited in this program. You can add as many supports as you need. It can also solve statically indeterminate beams.
* 3 types of loading are accepted in this program. Point load, distributed load, and point moment of inertia.
